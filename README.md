### For Admins, by Admins.

### 🛠 How it Works

NeuRader simplifies fleet management through a **Manager/Agent** architecture:

1. **Bootstrap**: Automatic identity exchange via secure handshake.
2. **Execute**: Parallel command blasting across nodes using Go routines.
3. **Upgrade**: Cascading binary updates that keep your entire fleet on the latest build automatically.
